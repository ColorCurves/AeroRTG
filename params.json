All of the power, none of the ugly.\r\n\r\n## Stats\r\n\r\nThis is a modernization of DaMichel's Aerodynamic RTG part developed in KSP 0.25. It has the same stats and cost as the stock RTG, but is designed in an aerodynamic, radially attached form factor. It is useful anytime you'd like to use an RTG but don't want lots of drag, or anytime you want a prettier alternative to the boxy stock RTG.\r\n\r\n## License and Permission\r\n\r\nOrginally created by DaMichel.\r\n\r\nUpdated and maintained by [permission from the original author](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/55842-partswip-damichels-partsfuselage-r2-2222015/&do=findComment&comment=2568712).\r\n\r\nLicensed under CC-BY-SA-3.0 (Attribution, Share Alike)\r\n\r\n",
